// Write a program to demonstrate unchecked exception.

// Unchecked Exceptions:
// Unchecked exceptions (also known as runtime exceptions) occur due to errors within the program logic itself. These exceptions are not verified by the compiler at compile-time.
// Examples of unchecked exceptions include ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
// We donâ€™t need to declare unchecked exceptions using the throws keyword.
